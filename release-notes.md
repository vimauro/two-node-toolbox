# Two-Node Toolbox Release Notes

## Version 0.5.5 - Cluster VM Inventory and Playbook Standardization
*Release Date: October 2025*

### New Features

#### Cluster VM Inventory Access
- Automatic discovery and inventory updates with cluster VMs after deployment
- Cluster VMs added to `[cluster_vms]` group with SSH ProxyJump configuration through hypervisor
- Direct Ansible access to cluster nodes from local machine without requiring direct network access
- Works with both dev-scripts and kcli deployment methods

**Usage example:**
```bash
ansible cluster_vms -m ping -i inventory.ini
ansible cluster_vms -m shell -a "uptime" -i inventory.ini
ansible-playbook my-cluster-playbook.yml -i inventory.ini -l cluster_vms
```

#### Resource Agents Build and Patch Automation
- New `make patch-nodes` command for building and patching resource-agents on cluster nodes
- Automated workflow: builds RPM on hypervisor, copies to localhost, patches all cluster nodes
- Eliminates manual RPM building and distribution steps
- Includes automated node reboots with etcd health verification

**Usage:**
```bash
# From deploy/ directory
make patch-nodes
```

#### Cluster Log Collection
- New `make get-tnf-logs` command for collecting etcd related logs from cluster VMs

**Usage:**
```bash
# From deploy/ directory
make get-tnf-logs
```

### Improvements



#### Playbook Host Targeting Standardization
- All playbooks now consistently use `metal_machine` host group
- Updated `kcli-install.yml`, `init-host.yml`, and `kcli-redfish.yml` to use `metal_machine`
- Prevents accidental execution on cluster VMs when using inventory with cluster VM entries
- Ensures consistent behavior across all deployment playbooks

### Bug Fixes

#### SSH Key Configuration
- Fixed `make ssh` command to use the configured SSH key from `instance.env`
- SSH script now correctly derives private key path from configured public key
- Resolves authentication issues when using non-default SSH keys

### Documentation Updates

- Comprehensive main README rewrite with clear quick-start options for AWS and external servers

#### Configuration Management
- Flexible RHSM credential configuration via environment variables or local files
- Automatic working directory configuration for storage optimization (`/home/dev-scripts`)
- Essential package installation including golang, make, git, and development tools

See `deploy/openshift-clusters/README-external-host.md` for detailed usage instructions.


## Version 0.5.3 - Fencing Validation Tools

#### Fencing Validator Script
- Added `helpers/fencing_validator.sh` for two-node cluster fencing validation
- Non-disruptive validation of STONITH configuration, node health, and etcd quorum

## Version 0.5.2 - KCLI Deployment Integration  
*Release Date: August 2025*

### New Features

#### KCLI Alternative Deployment Method
- Added `kcli-install` role providing alternative deployment method using kcli virtualization management tool
- Support for both fencing and arbiter topologies with kcli-based deployment

- Integration with kcli's BMC/Redfish simulation for fencing configuration
- Pacemaker fencing configuration available via `kcli-redfish.yml` playbook for TNF clusters

#### Modular Proxy Setup
- Refactored proxy functionality into dedicated `proxy-setup` role
- Separate task files for credentials, environment, infrastructure, and container management

#### Hypervisor Authentication Automation
- Automated cluster authentication file management for direct hypervisor access
- Authentication files automatically copied to standard `~/auth/` directory on hypervisor
- Default kubeconfig symlink (`~/.kube/config`) created for seamless `oc` command usage

#### KCLI Deployment
```bash
# Non-interactive fencing deployment
ansible-playbook kcli-install.yml -i inventory.ini
```

If you are installing a TNF cluster, Pacemaker configuration is done automatically. To do it manually:
```bash
# Configure pacemaker fencing for TNF clusters
ansible-playbook kcli-redfish.yml -i inventory.ini
```

### Limitations

#### KCLI Deployment Constraints
- **Manual Execution Required**: KCLI deployment not integrated with make command system

cd deploy
make deploy
```

### Supported Topologies

- **Two-Node with Arbiter (TNA)**: 2 full control planes + 1 arbiter node
- **Two-Node with Fencing (TNF)**: 2 control planes + software-based fencing via Pacemaker/Corosync

### Use Cases

- Edge computing deployments requiring HA
- Development and testing environments  
- CI/CD integration for cluster lifecycle testing
- Prototyping and validation workflows

**Note**: Two-node configurations are Technology Preview features and not covered under Red Hat production SLAs. Primarily targets OpenShift 4.19+ deployments on bare metal infrastructure.
