# TWO-NODE TOOLBOX

## Introduction

This repository provides automation for deploying and managing two-node OpenShift clusters for development and testing. It supports "Two-Node with Arbiter" (TNA) and "Two-Node with Fencing" (TNF) topologies using either dev-scripts or kcli deployment methods.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: AWS Hypervisor (Automated)

If you have AWS access, use the automated workflow. Most lifecycle operations can be performed from the [deploy](deploy/) folder using `make`:

```bash
cd deploy/

# Create AWS hypervisor and deploy cluster in one command
make deploy arbiter-ipi    # Two-Node with Arbiter (IPI method)
make deploy arbiter-agent  # Two-Node with Arbiter (Agent method)
make deploy fencing-ipi    # Two-Node with Fencing (IPI method)

# Other useful commands
make ssh                   # SSH into hypervisor
make info                  # Display instance information
make clean                 # Clean OpenShift cluster
make get-tnf-logs          # Collect cluster logs from VMs
make patch-nodes           # Build and patch resource-agents RPM
make help                  # Show all available commands
```

See [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md) for complete command reference and [deploy/aws-hypervisor/README.md](deploy/aws-hypervisor/README.md) for AWS setup instructions.

### Option 2: Bring Your Own Server

If you have an existing RHEL 9 server, initialize it and deploy a cluster:

```bash
cd deploy/openshift-clusters/

# One-time host initialization (configures RHEL, subscriptions, packages)
cp inventory.ini.sample inventory.ini
# Edit inventory.ini with your server details
ansible-playbook init-host.yml -i inventory.ini

# Deploy OpenShift cluster (choose one method)
ansible-playbook setup.yml -i inventory.ini        # dev-scripts (arbiter or fencing)
ansible-playbook kcli-install.yml -i inventory.ini # kcli (fencing only)
```

See [deploy/openshift-clusters/README-external-host.md](deploy/openshift-clusters/README-external-host.md) for detailed instructions.

## Deployment Methods

**dev-scripts**: Traditional method supporting both arbiter and fencing topologies with IPI and Agent-based installation options.
- Documentation: [deploy/openshift-clusters/README.md](deploy/openshift-clusters/README.md)

**kcli**: Modern method with simplified VM management, currently supports fencing topology.
- Documentation: [deploy/openshift-clusters/README-kcli.md](deploy/openshift-clusters/README-kcli.md)

## Available Topologies

**Two-Node with Arbiter (TNA)**: Two master nodes with a separate arbiter node for quorum. See [docs/arbiter/README.md](docs/arbiter/README.md)

**Two-Node with Fencing (TNF)**: Two master nodes with BMC-based fencing for automated node recovery. See [docs/fencing/README.md](docs/fencing/README.md)
